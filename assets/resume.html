        <h1>Peer Feedback at AWS Lambda</h1>
	<h2> AWS Lambda</h2>
        <ul class="square-ul">
            <li>Mike delivers result while never compromising on quality. During the per-function-concurrency project, he delivered highly complex changes under tight schedule, while producing high quality code. His feedback on all my documents and code-reviews have been meticulous and insightful, demonstrating his dedication to highest standards. Mike always eagerly takes upon any task and accomplishes it with ownership</li>
            <li>Mike has done a great job of soaking up information and learning as much as he can about relevant technical areas. This is an important skill for engineering, and as a result Mike has demonstrably grown as an engineer. He's also demonstrated strong willingness to facilitate discussions and investigate technical issues with his peers, which is another critical engineering skill.</li>
            <li>Mike is good at working hard to deliver a project as evidenced by Per-Function Concurrency. Mike showed great ownership in following up on operational details after the launch, and he showed an ability to dive deep in how he designed for various failure modes.</li>
            <li>Mike is one of the few people who has incredible ideas, and doesn't share them until they are fleshed out and ready to be consumed by others. Even though he is just starting out in the industry, he has already proven himself to be a leader in multiple areas, and I'm happy to continue to work with him in the upcoming year.</li>
            <li>Mike's focus and relentless attention to detail allowed him to build from scratch software to deliver per-function concurrency on time. Without Mike per-function concurrency won't be where it is today. From initial design through implementation and testing, he was the one, who was able to find those small but very important things that eventually drove us to resounding success.</li>
            <li>Mike's super power is to quickly understand the problem at hand and deliver results. He is also very perceptive and interested in knowing how things work across different teams.</li>
            <li>Mike's super-power is an extreme dedication to meeting his commitments; throughout 2017 he proved to be a diligent engineer. While working on per-function concurrency he worked nights and weekends to deliver the initial release. In order to do so, he had to self-teach himself a new network library and a number of concurrency concepts.</li>
        </ul>
